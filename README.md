Distributed Implementation of Jacobi Method
==================

Distributed implementations of Jacobi Method for solving systems of linear equations using OpenMPI.

This project aims to compare serial, parallel and distributed implementations of the algorithm with different number of variables, cores, and threads.

How they scale? How about the speed up and efficiency?

In this project you'll find out:

- OpenMPI implementations
- Test data
